yo
this is my first git/github project so if you have advice i'll gladly take it 


so this project is all about a complete linux shell using the QuickShell toolkit and the Hyprland Window Manager.
still in early development i guess.




now how to actually use the files in this repo...
the dependecies are QuickShell and Hyprland probably just install them with their respective deps ans all should be well
then mkdir ~/.config/quickshell and put all the qml files into the folder

suported hardware / OS's
ive only tested this on my own arch install on my own hardware so testing would be much apreciated
Arch - Linux 6.17.9.arch1-1  ~  hyprland 0.52.2-2  ~  quickshell 0.2.1-3 . this works


check the todo file to see waht needs doing, or checkout Quickshell-plans to see my visson for the future




as said earlier this is my first time using both git and github so there's going to be many roadblocks in the form of my own incompetence so please please please be patient
