yo
this is my first git/github project so if you have advice i'll gladly take it 


so this project is all about a complete linux shell using the QuickShell toolkit and the Hyprland Window Manager.
still in early development i guess.




now how to actually use the files in this repo...
the dependecies are QuickShell and Hyprland probably just install them with their respective deps ans all should be well
then mkdir ~/.config/quickshell and put all the qml files into the folder

suported hardware / OS's
ive only tested this on my own arch install on my own hardware so testing would be much apreciated
Arch - Linux 6.17.9.arch1-1  ~  hyprland 0.52.2-2  ~  quickshell 0.2.1-3 . this works


check the todo file to see waht needs doing, or checkout Quickshell-plans to see my visson for the future

main branch is stable and will be updated every major change to the code  
testing is unstable and will be broken at times as its were development is directly occurs 

to contribute, fork the project verify your additions work, then maake a PR to merge with testing. then once testing is stable it will be merged with main 

as said earlier this is my first time using both git and github so there's going to be many roadblocks in the form of my own incompetence so please please please be patient

you can contact me SolidTax/Tommy at hazzardoustommy@gmail.com
btw im in the process of switching between two github accounts rn
